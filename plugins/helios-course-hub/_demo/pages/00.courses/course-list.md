The **Helios Course Hub** gives your course a modern, clean, and organized home on the web – a place to share content, resources, and schedules that you fully own and control. It sits alongside your existing learning management system (Canvas, Moodle, Brightspace, etc.) and runs on nearly any web hosting service. It requires the [Grav Premium Helios theme](https://getgrav.org/premium/helios), which directly funds [Grav](https://getgrav.org), the free website platform it's built on.
