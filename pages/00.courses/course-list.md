The **Grav Helios Course Hub** is a ready-to-use companion site that gives your course a modern, clean, and organized home on the web – a place to openly share course materials and resources that you keep and control, independent of your institution's learning platform. Content is stored as simple text files you can keep locally, and it runs on nearly any web hosting service.

Made possible by the [Grav Premium Helios theme](https://getgrav.org/premium/helios), which directly funds [Grav](https://getgrav.org), the open-source platform it's built on. Want to learn more? Read the full [ReadMe](../readme) for setup instructions, features, and more.
